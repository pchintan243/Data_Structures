expression    priority
()            3
* /           2
+ -           1

Ex:  x-y/z-k*d

If operand is there write in stack value
in this example first x is come so write x
after that - is come
so put - into stack
after y is come write it after x.... so answer is xy
Then / is come

If in stack operator is already there then check priority first
Which operator we want to push into the stack is higher prority compare to which is already in stack so we push the operator into the stack
If it is lower then first pop the operator then push the operator which you want to push previous
If priority is same then also you can pop the operator from stack
Note: we cannot push the operator which is less priority compare to which is already in stack

step of example

expression      stack       postfix
x               empty       x
-               -           xy
y               -           xy 
/               -, /        xy
z               -, /        xyz
-               -           xyz/-
k               -           xyz/-k
*               -, *        xyz/-k
d               -, *        xyz/-kd
                            xyz/-kd*-
